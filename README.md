## Resources

I used a [Shirley's Sandwiches wiki fan page](http://community-sitcom.wikia.com/wiki/Shirley's_Sandwiches) for information and research on Shirley's Sandwiches from community. Since I've never watched the show, the information I used comes from there.

####Text Rotator Plugin

I used [Super Simple Text Rotator](http://www.thepetedesign.com/demos/jquery_super_simple_text_rotator_demo.html) to add text rotator to the pages -- rotating adjectives describibing the restaurant.

####Mean Menu

[This](https://github.com/meanthemes/meanMenu) really handy plugin allowed me to add a responsive hamburger menu my website.

####Custom Code

My custom code was really simple but did what I needed it to do. For interactive jquery element I added a mouseover event on a button that slid down a div with additional info. I used javascript code to add element and content to the page using the DOM.

####More Info
I added buttons to the page for the sake of visual representation but they are not supposed to go anywhere. I wanted to do this to alert the user to future features/functionality and for aesthetic purposes.
