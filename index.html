            <h1>Welcome to Shirley's Sandwiches</h1>
            <h2>Your Friendly College Deli</h2>
            <p>In the study group's third year together at Greendale, Shirley and Pierce form a business partnership and submit a proposal to Dean Pelton to open an eatery named Shirley's Sandwiches. It was to be located where the coffee shop "Hot & Brown" used to be before it was burned down. Although at first rejected in favor of a Subway franchise, the proposal is eventually accepted and Shirley and Pierce have a grand opening during the summer time for the shop. Its first appearance was in the Season Three episode "Introduction to Finality". </p>

            <p>After her husband, Andre Bennett, left Shirley and his family, she decided to go back to Community College. She took classes which would help her in her goal to one day start her own business based on her culinary skills. In their junior year at Greendale, Britta saw an opportunity for Shirley to make her dreams come true and suggested that she open a sandwich shop where the "Hot & Brown" coffee shop once stood. Pierce had been looking to invest his money in new business ventures and offered to help bankroll Shirley in this new enterprise. Shirley was reluctant at first as she wanted to focus on her upcoming nuptials to Andre, who had recently just proposed that they get married again. Britta decided to plan the wedding while Shirley puts her efforts into submitting a business proposal for Dean Pelton to consider. </p>
